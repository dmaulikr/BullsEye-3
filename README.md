# BullsEye
iOS game to get as close as possible to the random number. 
You objective is to get the slider as close as possible to the randomly chosen target.
The slider doesn't show the value so do your best "eyeball" it.
When you think you are close press the "Hit Me!" button and an alert will tell you your score.
